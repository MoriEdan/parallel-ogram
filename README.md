parallel-ogram
=========

It's like parallel-flickr but for Instagram.

Also: STOP NOW
=========

If you're reading this it means the application does **nothing** yet except let
you log in using the Instagram API as a validation service.

**It does not archive or display your Instagram photos yet.**

If you're comfortable working with parallel-flickr or Flamework, in general,
feel free to poke around and send patches or whatever.

I'm just making it all public now on principle. The rest will come with time.

{capture assign="email_subject"}{$cfg.site_name} has sent you an invite code!{/capture}
Hello! 

{$cfg.site_name} is sending you a form letter that contains an invite code so that you may use the site to backup your Instagram photos!

Your invite code is:

	{$cfg.abs_root_url}invite/{$invite.code|escape}/?redir=account/instagram/backups/

You should only need to visit that page once. If you've not already logged in to {$cfg.site_name} then you'll be bounced throught the Instagram API authentication flow so that pua may be granted "read" permissions to view (and backup) your photos.

Once you've done that you'll still need to confirm that you want the site to backup your photos.

There may be some bugs left in the mix but otherwise it should be All Good (tm).

Enjoy!

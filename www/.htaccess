# Hey! Everything in here is better suited to httpd.conf, since
# we get a performance boost if we can turn off AllowOverride and
# not have to stat the webroot for every request. On the other
# hand, this means we never have to touch apache once it's up.
# Flexibility over performance.
#
# In an ideal world, you'd stick it in here on dev and your build
# system would bundle the changes into (a file included in) httpd.conf
# for your production deployment. Yeah. Do that.

# ETags are a bad idea if you have multiple web servers. We'll do
# more explicit caching with Expires headers anyway.

# The base set of sensible PHP options. You could put these in your
# php.ini file too, but having them in your Apache config puts
# everything in one place. Magic quotes off because they are stupid.
# Register globals off for the same reason. Track errors is so that
# we can at least get at the error messages we hide using @func().
# last_modified is a bad idea if we have any dynamic content. Short
# tags make for a few saved bytes of cruft and are fine unless you're
# running another XML preprocessor over your code (wtf?).

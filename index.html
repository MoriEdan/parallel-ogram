    <div class="description">
      <p>It's like <a href="http://straup.github.com/parallel-flickr/">parallel-flickr</a> but for Instagram.</p>

      <p>parallel-ogram is a simple web application to create an archive of your
      Instragram photos (and <q>likes</q>) and to make that archive a living,
      breathing website of its own. It is not a replacement for Instagram but a
      <a href="http://www.aaronland.info/weblog/2012/02/14/incentivize/#pda2012">shadow copy</a> running in... parallel.</p>

      <p>You can filter you photos by well, Instagram filters and your likes
      by filter as well as photographer.</p>

      <p>You can archive photos for other Instagram users or just
      yourself. That's your business.</p>

      <p>parallel-ogram uses the Instagram API as a single-sign-on (SSO)
      provider so you simply log in via the Instagram website itself.</p>

    <h2>Caveats</h2>

    <h4>parallel-ogram is not hard to set up but there is still
    no <q>one-button</q> install yet.</h4>

    <p>In the meantime, setting up
    parallel-ogram is not very complicated if you've ever set up a
    plain-vanilla website that uses PHP and MySQL.</p>

    <h4>The Instagram API does not currently expose any consistent indication of
    whether a person's photos are public or not-public.</h4>

    <p>In the absence of that
    information parallel-ogram treats everything as private, meaning you're the
    only person who can see your photos. The exception to this rule is that you can
    see <em>other people's</em> photos that you've liked and vice versa</p>

    <p>At some point in the near-future I would like to add the ability to mark
    photos in parallel-ogram as public or private, independent of any Instagram
    settings, but that's not possible right now.</p>

    <h4>parallel-ogram does nothing about geo.</h4>

    <p>Location information for every photo is recorded in the database but
    currently it is not used for anything locally.</p>
